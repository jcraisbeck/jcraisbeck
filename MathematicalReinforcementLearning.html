							<h1>Mathematical Reinforcement Learning</h1>
							<p>
								My research topic is mathematical reinforcement learning, which <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22mathematical+reinforcement+learning%22&biw=1918&bih=2001&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1900%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F1%2F2022&tbm=">at time of writing</a> does not seem to have much of a definition, or a following. That may be because I have only affixed the word "mathematical" to the subject "reinforcement learning" as a way to placate my desire for rigor, but I do not think so. By mathematical reinforcement learning I mean an account of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> which focuses on a formal understanding of the structures which already exist in Reinforcement Learning and in [discrete-time] decision processes.
							</p>
							<p>
								I contend that, contrary to the trends present in Reinforcement Learning as a whole, formal mathematical definitions of decision processes are necessary for solid progress to be made in Reinforcement Learning, on problems of practical and theoretical importance. I hope that soon the fruits of the investigations resulting from those definitions will show the necessity of the definitions and the value of approaching Reinforcement Learning problems from a mathematical perspective, as the originator of our field, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman">Richard Bellman</a> did when he first approached the "<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.38.8.716">class of mathematical problems which arise in connection with situations which require that a bounded or unbounded sequence of operations be performed for the purpose of achieving a desired result.</a>" which he later called "<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R245.html">multistage decision processes</a>".
